Design points for autometadata processing.

At any point where we know new data is available, need to queue
the WS object for metadata processing.

If we know a Shock upload node was created, we start a timer?
to periodically check it for new data.

Want a multithreaded pool to process the AMD data.

Want to keep the set of objects to be processed in nonvolatile storage.

Separate concerns of shock upload from AMD processing.
We can use ASIO timers for the periodic checks as they will not overwhelm.
Need to map object ID to timer. Or use a single timer with a set of objects to check.

Shock object:
      std::set<PendingUpload> pending_uploads_

PendingUpload:
	std::string object_id;
	std::time creation_time;
	std::tm last_
